# Variables & Data Types

- Variables store data values.
- Use let for variables that can change, const for constants.
- Primitive data types include: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, bigint, symbol.
- typeof operator returns the type of a variable.

# Operators & Expressions

- Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %, ** (exponentiation).
- Comparison operators: ==, ===, !=, !==, <, <=, >, >=.
- Logical operators: && (and), || (or), ! (not).

# Strings & Template Literals

- Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes.
- Template literals use backticks ` and allow embedding expressions with ${}.
- Template literals support multi-line strings.

# Console Mastery

- console.log() outputs messages to the console.
- console.error() outputs error messages.
- console.table() displays data in a table format.

# Deconstruction Drill

- Functions can be declared with the function keyword or as arrow functions.
- Functions can have parameters with default values.
- Functions can return values or log directly.

## **Questions?**

- What exactly are primitive data types?
- What other data types exist?
- What exactly is the difference between let and const. When/where each one of them should be used?
- What is the skeleton of a function?
- What type of functions exist (at least within js)?
